Abstract
In this paper we generalize the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian by making use of
some operators based on Lie algebras su(1,1) and su(2), and study a mathematical
structure of Rabi floppings of these models in the strong coupling regime. We show
that Rabi frequencies are given by matrix elements of generalized coherent operators
(quant-ph/0202081) under the rotating-wave approximation.
In the first half we make a general review of coherent operators and generalized
coherent ones based on Lie algebras su(1,1) and su(2). In the latter half we carry out
a detailed examination of Frasca (quant-ph/0111134) and generalize his method,
and moreover present some related problems.
We also apply our results to the construction of controlled unitary gates in Quantum Computation. Lastly we make a brief comment on application to Holonomic
Quantum Computation.

Introduction

Coherent states or generalized coherent states play an important role in quantum physics,
in particular, quantum optics, see [1] and [2]. They also play an important one in mathematical physics. See the textbook [3]. For example, they are very useful in performing
stationary phase approximations to path integral, [4], [5], [6].
Coherent operators which produce coherent states are very useful because they are
unitary and easy to handle. The basic reason is probably that they are subject to the
elementary Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula. Many basic properties of them
are well-known, see [3] or [8].
Generalized coherent operators which produce generalized coherent states are also
useful. But they are not so easy to handle in spite of having the disentangling one
corresponding to the elementary BCH formula. In [7] and [14] the author determined all
matrix elements of generalized coherent operators based on Lie algebras su(1,1) and su(2).
They are interesting by themselves, but moreover have a very interesting application.
In [12] Frasca dealt with the Jaynes-Cummings model which describes a two-level
atom interacting with a single radiation mode (see [10] for a general review) in the strong
coupling regime (not weak coupling one !) and showed that Rabi frequencies are obtained
by matrix elements of coherent operator under the rotating-wave approximation. His aim
was to explain the recent experimental finding on Josephson junctions [11].
This is an interesting result and moreover his method can be widely generalized. See
also [13] for an another example dealt with in the strong coupling regime.
In this paper we generalize the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian by making use of some
operators based on Lie algebras su(1,1) and su(2), and study a mathematical structure of
Rabi floppings of these extended models in the strong coupling regime.
We show that (generalized) Rabi frequencies are also given by matrix elements of
generalized coherent operators under the rotating-wave approximation. We believe that
the results will give a new aspect to Quantum Optics or Mathematical Physics.
We also apply our results to the construction of controlled unitary gates in Quantum
1

Computation in the last section.
Lastly we discuss an application to Holonomic Quantum Computation, but our discussion is not complete.

2.1

Coherent and Generalized Coherent Operators
Coherent Operator

Let a(a ) be the annihilation (creation) operator of the harmonic oscillator. If we set
N  a a (: number operator), then
[N, a ] = a , [N, a] = -a , [a , a] = -1 .

(1)

Let H be a Fock space generated by a and a , and {|n | n  N  {0}} be its basis. The
actions of a and a on H are given by
a|n =



n|n - 1 , a |n =



n + 1|n + 1 , N|n = n|n

(2)

where |0 is a normalized vacuum (a|0 = 0 and 0|0 = 1). From (2) state |n for n  1
are given by
(a )n
|n =  |0 .
n!

(3)

These states satisfy the orthogonality and completeness conditions


m|n = mn ,
n=0

|n n| = 1 .

(4)

Definition We call a state
 -a
z

|z = eza

|0  U(z)|0

for z  C

the coherent state.

2.2

Generalized Coherent Operator Based on su(1, 1)

Let us state generalized coherent operators and states based on su(1, 1).
2

(5)

We consider a spin K (> 0) representation of su(1, 1)  sl(2, C) and set its generators
{K+ , K- , K3 } ((K+ ) = K- ),
[K3 , K+ ] = K+ ,

[K3 , K- ] = -K- ,

[K+ , K- ] = -2K3 .

(6)

We note that this (unitary) representation is necessarily infinite dimensional. The Fock
space on which {K+ , K- , K3 } act is HK  {|K, n |n  N  {0}} and whose actions are
K+ |K, n =

(n + 1)(2K + n)|K, n + 1 ,

K- |K, n =

n(2K + n - 1)|K, n - 1 ,

K3 |K, n = (K + n)|K, n ,

(7)

where |K, 0 is a normalized vacuum (K- |K, 0 = 0 and K, 0|K, 0 = 1). We have
written |K, 0 instead of |0 to emphasize the spin K representation, see [4]. From (7),
states |K, n are given by

(K+ )n

|K, n =

n!(2K)n

|K, 0 ,

(8)

where (a)n is the Pochammer's notation (a)n  a(a + 1) * * * (a + n - 1). These states
satisfy the orthogonality and completeness conditions


K, m|K, n = mn ,
n=0

|K, n K, n| = 1K .

(9)

Now let us consider a generalized version of coherent states :
Definition We call a state
z
|z = V (z)|K, 0  ezK+ -K- |K, 0

for z  C.

(10)

the generalized coherent state (or the coherent state of Perelomov's type based on su(1, 1)
in our terminology).
Here let us construct an example of this representation. First we set
K+ 

1 
a
2

2

1
1
1 
a a+
, K-  a2 , K3 
2
2
2

,

(11)

then it is easy to check that these satisfy the commutation relations (6). That is, the set
{K+ , K- , K3 } gives a unitary representation of su(1, 1)with spin K = 1/4 and 3/4, [3].
Now we also call an operator
1

 )2 -a2 }
z

S(z) = e 2 {z(a

3

for z  C

(12)

the squeezed operator, see the book [3].

2.3

Generalized Coherent Operator Based on su(2)

Let us state generalized coherent operators and states based on su(2).
We consider a spin J (> 0) representation of su(2)  sl(2, C) and set its generators
{J+ , J- , J3 } ((J+ ) = J- ),
[J3 , J+ ] = J+ ,

[J3 , J- ] = -J- ,

[J+ , J- ] = 2J3 .

(13)

We note that this (unitary) representation is necessarily finite dimensional. The Fock
space on which {J+ , J- , J3 } act is HJ  {|J, n |0  n  2J} and whose actions are
J+ |J, n =

(n + 1)(2J - n)|J, n + 1 ,

J- |J, n =

n(2J - n + 1)|J, n - 1 ,

J3 |J, n = (-J + n)|J, n ,

(14)

where |J, 0 is a normalized vacuum (J- |J, 0 = 0 and J, 0|J, 0 = 1). We have written
|J, 0 instead of |0 to emphasize the spin J representation, see [4]. From (14), states
|J, n are given by

(J+ )n
|J, n = 
|J, 0 .
n!2J Pn

(15)

These states satisfy the orthogonality and completeness conditions
2J

J, m|J, n = mn ,
n=0

|J, n J, n| = 1J .

(16)

Now let us consider a generalized version of coherent states :
Definition We call a state
z
|z = W (z)|J, 0  ezJ+ -J- |J, 0

for z  C.

(17)

the generalized coherent state (or the coherent state of Perelomov's type based on su(2)
in our terminology).
A comment is in order. We can construct the spin K and J representations by making
use of Schwinger's boson method. But we don't repeat here, see for example [7].

Matrix Elements of Coherent and Generalized Coherent Operators * * * [14]

Matrix Elements of Coherent Operator

We list matrix elements of coherent operators U(z).
The Matrix Elements The matrix elements of U(z) are :

where Ln () is the associated Laguerre's polynomial defined by

k - j j!

(20)

In particular Lk  Lk (0) is the usual Laguerre's polynomial and these are related to
diagonal elements of U(z).

3.2

Matrix Elements of Coherent Operator Based on su(1, 1)

We list matrix elements of V (z) coherent operators based on su(1, 1). In this case it is
always 2K > 1 (2K = 1 under some regularization).

(23)

The author doesn't know whether or not the right hand sides of (21) and (22) could be
written by making use of some special functions such as generalized Laguerre's functions
in (20). Therefore we set temporarily
m

Fm (n-m) (x : 2K) =

(-1)m-j
j=0

(2K + m + n - j)
(1 + x)j xm-j
(2K)(m - j)!(n - j)!j!

and Fm (0) (x; 2K) = Fm (x; 2K).

3.3

always 2J  N.

be written by making use of some special functions. We set temporarily

Jaynes-Cummings Models in the Strong Coupling
Regime

In [12] Frasca treated the Jaynes-Cummings model and developped some method to
calculate Rabi frequencies in the strong coupling regime. We in this section generalize the
model and method, and show that Rabi frequencies in our extended model are given by
matrix elements of generalized coherent operators under the rotating-wave approximation.
This gives a unified approach to them.
Let {1 , 2 , 3 } be Pauli matrices and 12 a unit matrix :




 0 1 

1 = 

1 0

,







 0 -i 

2 = 

i

0

 1

,

3 = 



0 

0 -1

,





 1 0 

12 = 

0 1

.

(29)

The Hamiltonian adopted in [12] is
(N)

HN = 12  a a +


3  1 + g1  (a + a)
2

(30)

where  is the frequency of the radiation mode,  the separation between the two levels
of the atom, g the coupling between the radiation field and the atom.
Moreover we want to treat the following Hamiltonians (our extension)
(K)
(J)


3  1K + g1  (K+ + K- ),
2

HJ = 12  J3 + 3  1J + g1  (J+ + J- ).
2

HK = 12  K3 +

(31)
(32)

To treat these three cases at the same time we set

{L+ , L- , L3 } =

and















(N)

{a , a, N}

(K)

{K+ , K- , K3 }

(J)

{J+ , J- , J3 }

H = H0 + V = 12  L3 +


3  1L + g1  (L+ + L- )
2

where we have written H instead of HL for simplicity.
7

(33)

(34)

Mysteriously enough we cannot solve these simple models completely (maybe non-integrable),
nevertheless we have found these models have a very rich structure.
For these (non-integrable) models we usually have two perturbation approaches :
Weak Coupling Regime (0 < g  )
H0 = 12  L3 +


3  1L ,
2

V = g1  (L+ + L- ).

(35)


3  1L .
2

(36)

Strong Coupling Regime (0 <   g)
H0 = 12  L3 + g1  (L+ + L- ),

V =

In the following we consider only the strong coupling regime (see [10] for the weak one).
First let us solve H0 which is a relatively easy task.
Let W be a Walsh-Hadamard matrix




1  1 1 
-1
W = 
=W
2 1 -1
then we can diagonalize 1 by using this H as 1 = W 3 W -1 . The eigenvalues of 1 is
{1, -1} with eigenvectors




1  1 
|1 =    ,

1  1

Then we have

given respectively

for  = 1 and n  N  {0}. For the latter convenience we set
Eigenvalues = {En },

Eigenvectors = {|{, n} }.

(42)

Then (37) can be written as
H0 =


n

En |{, n} {, n}|.
9

(43)

Next we would like to solve the following Schrdinger equation :
o
i


d
 = H = H0 + 3  1L ,
dt
2

(44)

where we have set h = 1 for simplicity. To solve this equation we appeal to the method

of constant variation. First let us solve
d
 = H0 ,
dt

(45)

(t) = U0 (t)0 = e-itH0 0

(46)

i
which general solution is given by

where 0 is a constant state. It is easy to see from (43)
U0 (t) = e-itH0 =


n

e-itEn |{, n} {, n}|.

The method of constant variation goes as follows. Changing like

(47)
0 - 0 (t),

we

insert (46) into (82). After some algebra we obtain
i

d

0 = U0  (3  1L )U0 0 .
dt
2

(48)

We have only to solve this equation. If we set
HF =

 
U0 (3  1L )U0 ,

(49)

then we have easily from (47)
HF =

(50)

In this stage we meet matrix elements of the coherent and generalized coherent
operators ex(L+ -L- ) in section 3 (z = z = x).

Here we divide HF into two parts


HF = HF + HF



where

m=n



|{, n} {-, n}|,

eit(m-n) m|ex(L+ -L- ) |n

|{, m} {-, n}|.

(51)
(52)

Noting
n|ex(L+ -L- ) |n

=

n|e-x(L+ -L- ) |n



by the results in section 3, HF can be written as


HF =


2

n|ex(L+ -L- ) |n {|{1, n} {-1, n}| + |{-1, n} {1, n}|} ,

n



from which we can diagonalize HF as


HF =


2

n



n|ex(L+ -L- ) |n  |{, n } {, n }|

(53)

if we define a new basis
1
|{, n } =  (|{1, n} + |{-1, n} ),
2

 = 1.

These states can be seen as so-called Schrdinger cat states, [15]. From these we have
o
1
|{1, n} =  {|{1, n } - |{-1, n } },
2
1
|{-1, n} =  {|{1, n } + |{-1, n } }.
2
Inserting these equations into (52) and taking some algebras we obtain


HF =

For that if we set 0 (t) as
0 (t) =


n

e-itEn, an, (t)|{, n } ,

(57)

then we have a set of complicated equations with respect to {an, }, see [12]. But it is
almost impossible to solve them. Therefore we make a daring assumption : for m < n
0 (t) =


e-itEm, am, (t)|{, m } +



e-itEn, an, (t)|{, n } .

(58)

That is, we consider only two terms with respect to {n|n  0}. After some algebras we
obtain

But we cannot still solve the above equations exactly (see Appendix), so let us make
so-called rotating-wave approximation. The resonance condition is

En, - Em, = (m - n)

(60)

for some  and  , and we reject the remaining term in (59). Then we obtain simple
equations :

(63)

then

These are two Rabi frequencies as shown in the following. It is important that Rabi
frequencies in our models are given by matrix elements of coherent and generalized
coherent operators !

We have obtained some solutions under the rotating-wave approximation. Now it may
be suited to compare our results with a recent experimental finding in [11], but this is
beyond our scope. See [12].
Let us conclude this section by a comment. Our ansatz (58) to solve the equation
is too restrictive. We want to use (57) to solve the equation, but it is very hard at this
stage.

(77)

where C2 = VectC {|0 , |1 }, then the solutions (70), (72), (74), (76) are kinds of controlled unitary operations (gates) which play a crucial role in Quantum Computation,
see for example [16]. For example, (76) is just one of controlled unitary gates expressed
graphically as

A comment is in order. [17] (and [18]) is considering the same subject. However the
authors in them treated it in the weak coupling regime, while we treated it in the strong
coupling regime. It is very interesting to investigate a deep relation (connection) between
them.

Discussion

One of motivations of this study is to apply our results to Holonomic Quantum Computation developped by Italian group (Pachos, Rasetti and Zanardi) and the author, see [19],
[20], [21], [22] and [23]--[27] and recent [28], [29].
In this theory we usually use the effective Hamiltonian of a single-mode field of Kerr
medium
H0 = XN(N - 1),

N = a a where X

is a constant

(79)

as a background and the real Hamiltonian is in one-qubit case given by
H(z, w) = W (z, w)H0W -1 (z, w)

(80)

where W is a product of coherent operator U(z) and squeezed one S(w) in section 2. In
the above Hamiltonian H0 the zero-eigenvalue is two-fold degenerate whose eigenvectors
are |0 and |1 . We set |vac = (|0 , |1 ). Then we can construct a connection form A on
the parameter space {(z, w)  C2 } as
A = vac|W -1 dW |vac

(81)



from (80) where d = dz z + dw w . By making use of this connection we can construct

a holonomy group Hol(A) ( U(2)) which is in this case equal to U(2). In Holonomic
Quantum Computation we use this holonomy group as unitary operations in Quantum
Computation. The point at issue is that we use not full property of the Hamiltonian but
only property of the zero-eigenvalue.
By the way, the Hamiltonian HF in (49)
HF =

 -1
U0 (3  1L )U0
2

where L = (N) or (K) or (J)

is very similar to (80). This system is always two-fold degenerate. Then a natural question
arises :
Problem Is it possible to perform a holonomic quantum computation by combining
the systems {(N), (K), (J)} ?
18

This is a very interesting and challenging problem.

(83)

because Ek,- = -Ek, .
We can give (82) a formal solution by infinite series (called Dyson series in Theoretical
Physics). Then we meet secular terms.
For example let us consider the following simple equation :
d
a = eit a with a(0) = c.
dt
The solution is given by
a(t) =







it
c exp e i-1

=0

c et

=0
19

That is, we meet the secular term.
By the way, we have known how to handle (simple) secular terms called Renormalization Group Method (Approach), see [30] for a general introduction.
Frasca in [31] has applied this method to the above equation. The conclusion is
interesting, but seems to be rather involved. We are now reconsidering his approach.
Therefore let us present
Problem Solve this matrix equation completely !
